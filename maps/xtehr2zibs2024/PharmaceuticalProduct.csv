-  Trade product code (HPK) 
-  Prescription code (PRK) 
-  Generic product code (GPK)

The HPK is the code for the trade product (with the brand name) as used per dose/per time the medication is taken (1 pill, 1 puff, 1ml).
The PRK contains als GPK information supplemented with information needed to prescribe the right product. This level is intended to facilitate generic prescription of drugs. 
The GPK defines the pharmaceutical characteristics of a product: ingredients, strengths, units, pharmaceutical form and route of administration.
