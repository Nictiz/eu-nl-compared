The FHIR procedure method extension (http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/procedure-method) cannot be used in R4 because it has a `0..1` cardinality which does not match the zib cardinality of `0..*` for this concept. The next release of FHIR, R5, will fix the cardinality to `0..*` (https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30769) allowing the replacement of this extension with the HL7 FHIR core extension.","copyright":"Copyright and related rights waived via CC0, https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.
