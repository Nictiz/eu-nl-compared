The extention holds information wether permission is given to the health professional(s) by the patient or legal representative to implement medical restraints.","purpose":"Implementing medical restraints is risky and can result in damage to the patient if they are not carefully implemented. Nurses fulfil an important role in identifying risks, observing the effect of the restraints and any changes to the policy in terms of medical restraints. Recording all information on the measures is of major importance for insight into decision-making, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the measures. In the event of a transfer to the next facility, the proper preparations can be taken to safely continue the care and to limit the risks to the patient and their environment.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-freedomrestrictingmeasures-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/FreedomRestrictingMeasures-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM FreedomRestrictingMeasures-v3.1(2017EN)"}],"kind":"complex-type","abstract":false,"contextType":"resource","context":["Procedure"],"type":"Extension","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension","derivation":"constraint","snapshot":{"element":[{"id":"Extension","path":"Extension","short":"Permission","definition":"The permission given to the health professional(s) by the patient or legal representative to implement medical restraints.","alias":["Toestemming"],"min":1,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Element","min":0,"max":"*"},"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"},{"key":"ext-1","severity":"error","human":"Must have either extensions or value[x], not both","expression":"extension.exists() != value.exists()","xpath":"exists(f:extension)!=exists(f:*[starts-with(local-name(.), 'value')])","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A"}]},{"id":"Extension.id","path":"Extension.id","representation":["xmlAttr"],"short":"xml:id (or equivalent in JSON)","definition":"unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
