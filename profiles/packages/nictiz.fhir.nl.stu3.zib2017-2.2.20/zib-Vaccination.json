Administering immunoglobulins is part of the medication overview. Vaccinations have lifelong relevance.\r\n\r\nMost vaccinations are carried out in the Netherlands as part of the RVP (Rijksvaccinatieprogramma, National Immunisation Program). RVP information is especially important for children. \r\n\r\nVaccinations are also relevant for adult patients such as transplant patients, dialysis patients and patients with a post-splenectomy status.
