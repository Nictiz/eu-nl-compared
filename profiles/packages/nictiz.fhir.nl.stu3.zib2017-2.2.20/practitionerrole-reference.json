This extension leads to slight duplication: a reference to a Practitioner provided in the PractitionerRole will also be given in the original Reference.      If only the specialism and/or organization are available, the Reference.extension.valueReference.display will be duplicated into the original Reference.display.      Systems that do not know about the extension would thus still have access to the regular Reference to Practitioner and to Reference.display.      The PractitionerRole resource came into being shortly before releasing FHIR STU3 and only a few resources had been updated for it.      As of FHIR R4 all relevant references for PractitionerRole are covered and this extension will no longer be required.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","kind":"complex-type","abstract":false,"contextType":"datatype","context":["Reference"],"type":"Extension","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension","derivation":"constraint","snapshot":{"element":[{"id":"Extension","path":"Extension","short":"Optional Extensions Element","definition":"Optional Extension Element - found in all resources.","min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Element","min":0,"max":"*"},"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"},{"key":"ext-1","severity":"error","human":"Must have either extensions or value[x], not both","expression":"extension.exists() != value.exists()","xpath":"exists(f:extension)!=exists(f:*[starts-with(local-name(.), 'value')])","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A"}]},{"id":"Extension.id","path":"Extension.id","representation":["xmlAttr"],"short":"xml:id (or equivalent in JSON)","definition":"unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
