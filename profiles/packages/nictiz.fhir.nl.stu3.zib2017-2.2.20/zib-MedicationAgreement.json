For example, when the hospital uses a different formulary than the community pharmacy. For reasons of efficiency, for example, one gastric acid inhibitor has been chosen in the hospital: pantoprazole.\r\nUpon admission, a patient with omeprazole is converted to pantoprazole for the duration of the stay. When discharged, the patient goes back to omeprazole.\r\nIt is clear that something can go wrong here and that the patient takes both omeprazole and pantoprazole when there is no intervention. In the hospital's medication agreement for pantoprazole a remark can be made about the deviation so that it is clear that pantoprazole is the substitute for omeprazole or that it should be used in addition to omeprazole.\r\nAnother example are the half strengths. The hospital sometimes stocks tablets with half the strength of the normal trade preparation (own production). Where the patient enters the hospital on 25 mg chlortalidone, half a tablet once a day, he receives 12.5 mg intramural chlortalidone, one tablet once a day. Then the nursing does not have to break tablets in this case. Here there is a risk that the patient will use the 25 mg again at home, but then a whole tablet at a time in stead of half a tablet. By means of an explanation in the medication agreement (Additional information) of the last chlortalidone 25 mg, it can be indicated whether this has been a intended increase.","alias":["extensions","user content","MedicatieafspraakAanvullendeInformatie"],"min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"DomainResource.extension","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-Medication-AdditionalInformation"}],"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"},{"key":"ext-1","severity":"error","human":"Must have either extensions or value[x], not both","expression":"extension.exists() != value.exists()","xpath":"exists(f:extension)!=exists(f:*[starts-with(local-name(.), 'value')])","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A"},{"identity":"hcim-medicationagreement-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:9.6.23283","comment":"MedicationAgreementAdditionalInformation"}]},{"id":"MedicationRequest.extension:additionalInformation.id","path":"MedicationRequest.extension.id","representation":["xmlAttr"],"short":"xml:id (or equivalent in JSON)","definition":"unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).

For example, when the hospital uses a different formulary than the community pharmacy. For reasons of efficiency, for example, one gastric acid inhibitor has been chosen in the hospital: pantoprazole.\r\nUpon admission, a patient with omeprazole is converted to pantoprazole for the duration of the stay. When discharged, the patient goes back to omeprazole.\r\nIt is clear that something can go wrong here and that the patient takes both omeprazole and pantoprazole when there is no intervention. In the hospital's medication agreement for pantoprazole a remark can be made about the deviation so that it is clear that pantoprazole is the substitute for omeprazole or that it should be used in addition to omeprazole.\r\nAnother example are the half strengths. The hospital sometimes stocks tablets with half the strength of the normal trade preparation (own production). Where the patient enters the hospital on 25 mg chlortalidone, half a tablet once a day, he receives 12.5 mg intramural chlortalidone, one tablet once a day. Then the nursing does not have to break tablets in this case. Here there is a risk that the patient will use the 25 mg again at home, but then a whole tablet at a time in stead of half a tablet.
