A Dutch ContactPoint still is a proper FHIR ContactPoint, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype. The table below explains how the HCIM concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements. The HCIM code itself should also be included using the TelecomType extension.\r\n\r\n| HCIM                                               | `.ext:TelecomType` | `.system` | `.use`   |\r\n|----------------------------------------------------|:------------------:|:---------:|:--------:|\r\n| Primary Home Land Line                             | _LL_               | _phone_   | _home_   |\r\n| Temporary Land Line                                | _LL_               | _phone_   | _temp_   |\r\n| Primary Work Land Line                             | _LL_               | _phone_   | _work_   |\r\n|                                                    |                    |           |          |\r\n| Primary Home Fax                                   | _FAX_              | _fax_     | _home_   |\r\n| Temporary Fax                                      | _FAX_              | _fax_     | _temp_   |\r\n| Primary Work Fax                                   | _FAX_              | _fax_     | _work_   |\r\n|                                                    |                    |           |          |\r\n| Primary Home Mobile Phone                          | _MC_               | _phone_   | _home_   |\r\n| Temporary Mobile Phone                             | _MC_               | _phone_   | _temp_   |\r\n| Primary Work Mobile Phone                          | _MC_               | _phone_   | _work_   |\r\n|                                                    |                    |           |          |\r\n| Primary Home Pager                                 | _PG_               | _pager_   | _home_   |\r\n| Temporary Pager                                    | _PG_               | _pager_   | _temp_   |\r\n| Primary Work Pager                                 | _PG_               | _pager_   | _work_   |\r\n|                                                    |                    |           |          |\r\n| Private email address                              |                    | _email_   | _home_   |\r\n| Work email address                                 |                    | _email_   | _work_   |\r\n|                                                    |                    |           |          |\r\n| Mobile phone number undetermined private/business  |                    | _phone_   | _mobile_ |","comment":"If this is empty, then refer to the location's contacts.","alias":["Contactgegevens"],"min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"HealthcareService.telecom","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"ContactPoint","profile":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-contactpoint"}],"example":[{"label":"Mobile business phone number.
