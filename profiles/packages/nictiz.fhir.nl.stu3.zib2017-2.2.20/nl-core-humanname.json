For this reason, extensions are added onto the base HumanName element to mark the meaning of each part. A Dutch HumanName is still a proper FHIR HumanName; however, there might be an incompatibilty with the default FHIR mechanism for communicating given names. See the compatibility note below for more information.\r\n\r\nThe extension elements cover birth name (NL: eigennaam / geslachtsnaam) and partner/spouse name. Both may have a prefix (NL: voorvoegsel). When a person marries, he or she may keep their own name, assume the partner name, append the partner name to their own name, or the other way around.\r\n\r\n**Incompatibility note**: It has come to light that this specification deviates from the way that the HumanName datatype is normally used. This will be fixed in a future release. However, current implementations should be aware of the special considerations regarding the use of this specification. \r\n\r\nThe issue at hand is the way alternative representations of a name, like initials or a nickname, are communicated. Normally this is done using multiple HumanName instances, which are differentiated using the `.use` element. However, this specification allows for including all alternative representations in the _same_ HumanName instance, with the expectation that the extensions provide enough information for receiving systems to differentiate them. However, this means that contrary to the normal usage of this datatype, repetitions of `.given` names cannot be concatenated to get the full list of given names; the list might be a mix of full names, nicknames and initials.\r\n\r\nSince multiple implementations are based on this specification, sending systems are advised (but not required) to keep the approach with one HumanName instance, while receiving systems should be able to handle this one-instance approach. More specifically:\r\n\r\n* Sending and receiving systems SHOULD always use the specified extensions when using this datatype.\r\n* Sending systems are encouraged to populate the `.text` element to unambigiously communicate the person's name.\r\n* Sending systems are encouraged to send either the full given names or the initials, but not both. This alleviates the duplication of names in `.given`.\r\n* When a sending system uses the current one-instance approach for communicating multiple representations, `.use` MAY NOT be populated. After all, it is not possible to select a single `.use` when the instance contains different representations.\r\n* When a receiving system interprets the instance as the single-instance-multiple-representations approach, the `.given` names marked as initials SHOULD be interpreted as alternatives to the full given names. Note the underlying HCIM expects both the _list_ of full names and _list_ of initials to be a single string; there's no match for an initial to a full name. The instance SHOULD be regarded as using this approach when:\r\n  * They encounter a single instance\r\n  * And the `.use` element is absent\r\n  * And all the name parts are differentiated using the specified extensions\r\n* In any other circumstance, receiving systems SHOULD interpret the usage as the normal use.\r\n\r\nExample: miss Irma XXX_Helleman marries mister de Haas and assumes the name Irma XXX_Helleman-de Haas:\r\n\r\n* `.family` = \"XXX_Helleman-de Haas\"\r\n* `.given` = \"Irma\" (with `.given:iso21090EnQualifier` = _BR_)\r\n* `.family:humannameOwnName` = \"XXX_Helleman\"\r\n* `.family:humannamePartnerPrefix` = \"de \"\r\n* `.family:humannamePartnerName` = \"Haas\"","min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Element","min":0,"max":"*"},"example":[{"label":"Structured HumanName (preferred above unstructured)","valueHumanName":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-assembly-order","valueCode":"NL4"}],"text":"Irma XXX_Helleman-de Haas","family":"XXX_Helleman-de Haas","_family":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name","valueString":"XXX_Helleman"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-prefix","valueString":"de"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-name","valueString":"Haas"}]},"given":["Irma"],"_given":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier","valueCode":"CL"}]}]}},{"label":"Unstructured HumanName","valueHumanName":{"text":"Irma XXX_Helleman-de Haas"}}],"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"},{"key":"nl-core-humanname-1","severity":"error","human":"if you specify a prefix for an own name then an own name is also expected","expression":"name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-prefix').empty().not() implies name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name').empty().not()","xpath":"not(f:extension[@url='http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-prefix']) or f:extension[@url='http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name']","source":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-humanname"},{"key":"nl-core-humanname-2","severity":"error","human":"if you specify a voorvoegsel for a partner name then a partner name is also expected","expression":"name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-prefix').empty().not() implies name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-name').empty().not()","xpath":"not(f:extension[@url='http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-prefix']) or f:extension[@url='http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-name']","source":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-humanname"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"v2","map":"XPN"},{"identity":"rim","map":"EN (actually, PN)"},{"identity":"servd","map":"ProviderName"},{"identity":"hcim-nameinformation-v2.0.1-2015EN","map":"NL-CM:0.1.6","comment":"NameInformation"},{"identity":"hcim-nameinformation-v3.0-2016EN","map":"NL-CM:0.1.6","comment":"NameInformation"},{"identity":"hcim-nameinformation-v1.0.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:20.4.1","comment":"NameInformation"},{"identity":"BRP","map":"02","comment":"Naam"}]},{"id":"HumanName.id","path":"HumanName.id","representation":["xmlAttr"],"short":"xml:id (or equivalent in JSON)","definition":"unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).

For this reason, extensions are added onto the base HumanName element to mark the meaning of each part. A Dutch HumanName is still a proper FHIR HumanName; however, there might be an incompatibilty with the default FHIR mechanism for communicating given names. See the compatibility note below for more information.\r\n\r\nThe extension elements cover birth name (NL: eigennaam / geslachtsnaam) and partner/spouse name. Both may have a prefix (NL: voorvoegsel). When a person marries, he or she may keep their own name, assume the partner name, append the partner name to their own name, or the other way around.\r\n\r\n**Incompatibility note**: It has come to light that this specification deviates from the way that the HumanName datatype is normally used. This will be fixed in a future release. However, current implementations should be aware of the special considerations regarding the use of this specification. \r\n\r\nThe issue at hand is the way alternative representations of a name, like initials or a nickname, are communicated. Normally this is done using multiple HumanName instances, which are differentiated using the `.use` element. However, this specification allows for including all alternative representations in the _same_ HumanName instance, with the expectation that the extensions provide enough information for receiving systems to differentiate them. However, this means that contrary to the normal usage of this datatype, repetitions of `.given` names cannot be concatenated to get the full list of given names; the list might be a mix of full names, nicknames and initials.\r\n\r\nSince multiple implementations are based on this specification, sending systems are advised (but not required) to keep the approach with one HumanName instance, while receiving systems should be able to handle this one-instance approach. More specifically:\r\n\r\n* Sending and receiving systems SHOULD always use the specified extensions when using this datatype.\r\n* Sending systems are encouraged to populate the `.text` element to unambigiously communicate the person's name.\r\n* Sending systems are encouraged to send either the full given names or the initials, but not both. This alleviates the duplication of names in `.given`.\r\n* When a sending system uses the current one-instance approach for communicating multiple representations, `.use` MAY NOT be populated. After all, it is not possible to select a single `.use` when the instance contains different representations.\r\n* When a receiving system interprets the instance as the single-instance-multiple-representations approach, the `.given` names marked as initials SHOULD be interpreted as alternatives to the full given names. Note the underlying HCIM expects both the _list_ of full names and _list_ of initials to be a single string; there's no match for an initial to a full name. The instance SHOULD be regarded as using this approach when:\r\n  * They encounter a single instance\r\n  * And the `.use` element is absent\r\n  * And all the name parts are differentiated using the specified extensions\r\n* In any other circumstance, receiving systems SHOULD interpret the usage as the normal use.\r\n\r\nExample: miss Irma XXX_Helleman marries mister de Haas and assumes the name Irma XXX_Helleman-de Haas:\r\n\r\n* `.family` = \"XXX_Helleman-de Haas\"\r\n* `.given` = \"Irma\" (with `.given:iso21090EnQualifier` = _BR_)\r\n* `.family:humannameOwnName` = \"XXX_Helleman\"\r\n* `.family:humannamePartnerPrefix` = \"de \"\r\n* `.family:humannamePartnerName` = \"Haas\"","example":[{"label":"Structured HumanName (preferred above unstructured)","valueHumanName":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-assembly-order","valueCode":"NL4"}],"text":"Irma XXX_Helleman-de Haas","family":"XXX_Helleman-de Haas","_family":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name","valueString":"XXX_Helleman"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-prefix","valueString":"de"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-name","valueString":"Haas"}]},"given":["Irma"],"_given":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier","valueCode":"CL"}]}]}},{"label":"Unstructured HumanName","valueHumanName":{"text":"Irma XXX_Helleman-de Haas"}}],"constraint":[{"key":"nl-core-humanname-1","severity":"error","human":"if you specify a prefix for an own name then an own name is also expected","expression":"name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-prefix').empty().not() implies name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name').empty().not()","xpath":"not(f:extension[@url='http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-prefix']) or f:extension[@url='http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name']"},{"key":"nl-core-humanname-2","severity":"error","human":"if you specify a voorvoegsel for a partner name then a partner name is also expected","expression":"name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-prefix').empty().not() implies name.family.extension('http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-name').empty().not()","xpath":"not(f:extension[@url='http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-prefix']) or f:extension[@url='http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-partner-name']"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-nameinformation-v2.0.1-2015EN","map":"NL-CM:0.1.6","comment":"NameInformation"},{"identity":"hcim-nameinformation-v3.0-2016EN","map":"NL-CM:0.1.6","comment":"NameInformation"},{"identity":"hcim-nameinformation-v1.0.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:20.4.1","comment":"NameInformation"},{"identity":"BRP","map":"02","comment":"Naam"}]},{"id":"HumanName.extension","path":"HumanName.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"HumanName.extension:humannameAssemblyOrder","path":"HumanName.extension","sliceName":"humannameAssemblyOrder","alias":["Voorkeursvolgorde van de naamdelen."],"type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-assembly-order"}],"binding":{"strength":"required","description":"Human Name Assembly Order","valueSetReference":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/11179-permitted-value-conceptmap","valueReference":{"reference":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/NaamgebruikCodelijst-to-HumanNameAssemblyOrder","display":"NaamgebruikCodelijst-to-HumanNameAssemblyOrder"}}],"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/name-assembly-order"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-nameinformation-v2.0.1-2015EN","map":"NL-CM:0.1.34","comment":"NameUsage.
