A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.\r\n\r\nTo have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.\r\n\r\n**Separate address parts**\r\n\r\nThe first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.\r\n\r\n**Custom address types**\r\n\r\nThe second addition is that the HCIM defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the HCIM concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well). The HCIM code itself should also be included using the AddressType extension.\r\n\r\n| HCIM                              |` .ext:AddressType` | `.ext:official` | `.use` | `.type`    |\r\n|-----------------------------------|:------------------:|:---------------:|:------:|:----------:|\r\n| Postal Address/Postadres          | _PST_              |                 |        | _postal_   |\r\n| Primary Home/Officieel adres      | _HP_               | true            | _home_ |            |\r\n| Visit Address/Woon-/verblijfadres | _PHYS_             |                 | _home_ | _physical_ |\r\n| Temporary Address/Tijdelijk adres | _TMP_              |                 | _temp_ |            |\r\n| Work Place/Werkadres              | _WP_               |                 | _work_ |            |\r\n| Vacation Home/Vakantie adres      | _HV_               |                 | _temp_ |            |\r\n\r\n If Address.type is _both_ then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical). Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.\r\n\r\nNOTE: FHIR core defines the AD-use extension to further specify the postal address type. However, the ValueSet used in that extension doesn't completely match the HCIM ValueSet. Therefore, a custom extension has been made. This doesn't preclude the use of the AD-use extension.","comment":"Note: address is for postal addresses, not physical locations.","alias":["AdresInformatie"],"min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Element","min":0,"max":"*"},"example":[{"label":"Example of a Vacation Home address","valueAddress":{"extension":[{"url":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-AddressInformation-AddressType","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AddressUse","code":"HV","display":"Vakantie adres"}]}}],"use":"temp","line":["Binnenkant 12A Hoog"],"_line":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-streetName","valueString":"Binnenkant"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-houseNumber","valueString":"12"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-buildingNumberSuffix","valueString":"A"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-unitID","valueString":"Hoog"}]}],"city":"Amsterdam","state":"NH","postalCode":"1000AA","country":"NLD"}},{"label":"Example of a Primary Home address","valueAddress":{"extension":[{"url":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-AddressInformation-AddressType","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AddressUse","code":"HP","display":"Officieel adres"}]}},{"url":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official","valueBoolean":true}],"use":"home","line":["Binnenkant to 10"],"_line":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-streetName","valueString":"Binnenkant"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-additionalLocator","valueString":"to"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-houseNumber","valueString":"10"}]}],"city":"Amsterdam","state":"NH","postalCode":"1001AA","country":"NLD"}}],"condition":["ele-1","nl-streetname-if-official-and-other-line-parts"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"},{"key":"nl-streetname-if-official-and-other-line-parts","requirements":"This constraint checks conformance against the Dutch BRP constraints on address parts.

A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.\r\n\r\nTo have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.\r\n\r\n**Separate address parts**\r\n\r\nThe first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.\r\n\r\n**Custom address types**\r\n\r\nThe second addition is that the HCIM defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the HCIM concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well). The HCIM code itself should also be included using the AddressType extension.\r\n\r\n| HCIM                              |` .ext:AddressType` | `.ext:official` | `.use` | `.type`    |\r\n|-----------------------------------|:------------------:|:---------------:|:------:|:----------:|\r\n| Postal Address/Postadres          | _PST_              |                 |        | _postal_   |\r\n| Primary Home/Officieel adres      | _HP_               | true            | _home_ |            |\r\n| Visit Address/Woon-/verblijfadres | _PHYS_             |                 | _home_ | _physical_ |\r\n| Temporary Address/Tijdelijk adres | _TMP_              |                 | _temp_ |            |\r\n| Work Place/Werkadres              | _WP_               |                 | _work_ |            |\r\n| Vacation Home/Vakantie adres      | _HV_               |                 | _temp_ |            |\r\n\r\n If Address.type is _both_ then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical).
