Clients use date parameter searches as described by the FHIR specification: http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/search.html#date.     Servers are expected to take the MedicationUse-Duration extension (http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-MedicationUse-Duration) into account when processing a client's search.      This means that either a Period.start + Period.end or Period.start + Duration is used to determine the search results.      To illustrate the expected behavior: if a Period.start and a Duration are known, but not the Period, the Duration should be added to the Period.start date to calculate the Period.end.      The calculated Period.end date is then used to determine the search results.","expression":"MedicationRequest.extension('http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-Medication-PeriodOfUse') | MedicationDispense.extension('http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-Medication-PeriodOfUse')","xpath":"f:MedicationRequest/f:extension[@url='http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-Medication-PeriodOfUse'] | f:MedicationDispense/f:extension[@url='http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-Medication-PeriodOfUse']","xpathUsage":"normal","comparator":["eq","le","ge"]}
